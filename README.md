**Project Description**

Our users will be mainly beginner level investors, but those groups such as advanced investor and community members can access the information as well. As our site will not be collecting any private or identifying information, our website will have full public-facing data so that any user will be able to access the prediction information.

The information that our users will be viewing is how volitile a stock is, including how much much a particular stock is talked about as well as volitility in the past. Additionally, we will display some stocks with high levels of volitility.

Some forms of interaction include:

* A navigation bar that allows users to click on the following pages:
    * Home
    * News Analytics page where users can select a stock and check its volitility graph. 

Our app will help to solve the issue of beginner level investors not knowing which stocks are more volitile. This accomplishes it by informing the users which stock might be volitile.
